This is a 2-player tic-tac-toe game that I created at Jacksonville State University. This was an individual project assigned by professor
Jason Snellen. Like many of his assignments, he provided the documentation and the skeleton for this assignment. This first part of this 
project was to create a basic tic tac toe game that could run using basic text. The second portion of this project was implementing Java's
GUI. This made the game look much more professional and also created a challenge for me because I had never worked with GUI before.
